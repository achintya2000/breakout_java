# Game Plan
## Achintya Kumar


### Breakout Variant
One variant of breakout I found to be interesting was the Brick Breaker Escape model. I found the coin gameplay to be interesting because now to increase your score you not only hit the bricks but also need to move the paddle effectively to collect coins and keep the ball in play. Some of the mechanics were also very interesting such as having to hit special switches to open areas of the game so that the ball can hit the bricks. 
### General Level Descriptions
There will be three levels in the game that increase in difficulty. 
- The first level will be 4x5 grid of bricks that include 2 pink bricks scattered amongst single and multi hit bricks. There will be no bomb bricks in the first level.
- The second level will be a 5x5 grid and have only 1 pink brick. There will be a greater proportion of multi hit bricks compared to single hit bricks. There will be 2 bomb bricks scattered as well.
- The final level is the most challenging and be a 6x5 grid. There will be no pink bricks. All the bricks will be multi hit. There will be 5 bomb bricks in the level layout.
### Bricks Ideas
- The first brick I will include is the standard brick that takes 1 hit to make disappear. 
- The second brick type will be the multi-hit brick which takes 2-3 hits to make completely disappear.
- The third brick type will be the bomb brick. A few of these will be scattered around the map. If the ball hits this brick the player will lose a life and the ball will reset.
- The fourth brick is the specially colored pink brick which is guaranteed to drop the heart power up.
### Power Up Ideas
- Increased paddle length - obtaining this power up will increase the size of your paddle allowing a greater surface area to hit the ball
- Ball slowdown - this power up will slow down the velocity of the ball increasing the time you are given to react to its position
- Hearts - obtaining a heart will grant you an extra life
### Cheat Key Ideas
In addition to what is required by the specifications I will do:
- Bomb Disposal Unit - entering this cheat code will cause all the bomb block to disappear from the level
- Super Powered Ball - if one enters this cheat code all bricks in the level will take only one hit to destroy
- God - entering the god mode cheat will give you the previous two cheats and over a million lives
### Something Extra
The game will keep track of the highest score earned by a player. This is a substantial addition because it adds replay value to the game. New or existing players will be motivated to beat the high score and keep playing the game.
